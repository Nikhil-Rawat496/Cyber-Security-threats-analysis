- Year slicer to filter all visuals by year
- Visuals:
  - Bar Chart: **Financial Loss by Year and Severity**
  - Bar Chart: **Attack Type & Vulnerability vs. Affected Users**
  - Table: **YoY Financial Loss Comparison**
  - Bar Chart: **Threats by Defense Mechanism**

## Insights Uncovered
- Nation-state actors caused the highest financial losses globally.
- Top 3 most targeted industries: Finance, Healthcare, Government.
- Defense Mechanisms vary in effectiveness; some countries have significantly slower resolution times.
- Most exploited vulnerabilities lead to large-scale user impact.
- Financial losses have increased significantly post-2020.
